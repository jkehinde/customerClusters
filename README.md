# customerClusters
This a k-means clustering problem  that puts customers into groups based on annual income and in store points
As the customer buy more things the they will get more points. By putting these customers into their respective clusters, the company is 
able to target specfic groups when they want to release a new product

This code is split into the following sections

1. Importing the dataset 

2. Using the elbow method 
    * This analyzes your data and tell you the amount of clusters you should have for you're dataset 
  
3. Fitting the K-means to the dataset
    * Now that we know the optimal amount of clusters for out data set we can now fit our model on it

4. Visualising the clusters
    * Here you will 5 cluster that have been scaled so I created a plot so you can see it with the real number
  
5. A plot without sclaing 
    * Now we ahve a legend and I have describe what I believe the customer to be in each cluster
